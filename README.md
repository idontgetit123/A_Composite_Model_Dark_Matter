# A Composite Three‑Body Model for Dark Matter
### James Howland (2026)

This repository contains the white paper and technical expansion for a proposed
three‑body composite dark matter candidate consisting of a proton, negaton, and
neutraltron in a stable figure‑8 orbital configuration.

## 📄 Additional Documentation

For extended theoretical material related to the Figure‑8 Composite Dark Matter Model, see:

- **Speculative Extension: O(o)O as a Vacuum‑Bound Capacitance Structure**  
  [`/docs/extension_vacuum_capacitor.md`](docs/extension_vacuum_capacitor.md)

This document explores an optional interpretation of the O(o)O configuration as a neutral, vacuum‑embedded capacitance mechanism that temporarily stores and returns energy in a phase‑locked cycle.
