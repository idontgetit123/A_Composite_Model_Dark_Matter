### Note on Resonance Behavior

Howland’s Law does not change when the positive and negative contributors have different effective circumferences. The law still states that capacitance is proportional to total circumference multiplied by the number of contributors. However, when the contributors are unequal, the neutral carrier naturally receives unequal energy inputs per cycle.

This does not modify the law—it simply produces a predictable resonance pattern.

Because the larger‑circumference contributor injects more energy, the neutral carrier occasionally completes an extra loop around that side before the full cycle resets. Over time, the system settles into a stable loop‑count ratio that reflects the circumference ratio of the contributors. For example, if the contributors differ in a 3:4 ratio, the neutral carrier will trace a repeating pattern with three loops around one side and four around the other.

This resonance behavior is not an exception or correction to Howland’s Law. It is the expected dynamical outcome of applying the law to unequal contributors, and anyone familiar with the law would anticipate these extra loops as a natural consequence of the geometry..
