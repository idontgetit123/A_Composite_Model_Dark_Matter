## Proposed Howland’s Law of Geometric Capacitance

**Statement (Howland’s Law):**  
For a composite vacuum‑embedded particle with internal circulating sub‑particles, the effective vacuum capacitance of its O(o)O structure is directly proportional to the total circumferential path length of its constituent sub‑particles.

Formally, for \(N\) internal circulating sub‑particles with orbital radii \(r_i\):

\[
C_H \propto \sum_{i=1}^{N} 2\pi r_i
\]

where:

- \(C_H\) is the **Howland geometric capacitance** of the O(o)O structure,
- \(r_i\) is the effective orbital radius of the \(i\)-th sub‑particle,
- the proportionality constant encodes vacuum properties and the specific deformation mode of the O(o)O configuration.

**Interpretation:**  
The capacity of the O(o)O structure to store and later return energy is not arbitrary; it is **geometrically quantized** by the internal orbital circumferences of the composite particle. Larger total path length → higher geometric capacitance; smaller total path length → lower geometric capacitance.

This law ties the dark‑matter particle’s energy‑storage behavior directly to its internal figure‑8 geometry, making capacitance an emergent property of orbital structure rather than a free parameter.
