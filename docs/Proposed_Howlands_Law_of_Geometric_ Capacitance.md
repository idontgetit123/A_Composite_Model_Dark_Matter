## Howland’s Law of Geometric Capacitance

**Statement (Howland’s Law):**  
For a composite vacuum‑embedded particle with internal circulating sub‑particles, the effective vacuum capacitance of its O(o)O structure is directly proportional to the total circumferential path length of its constituent sub‑particles **and the number of charge‑like contributors feeding it per cycle**.

Formally, for \(N\) internal circulating sub‑particles with orbital radii \(r_i\), and \(k\) effective charge contributors (e.g., \(k = 2\) for a + and − pair):

\[
C_H \propto k \sum_{i=1}^{N} 2\pi r_i
\]

In the specific case of one positive and one negative contributor:

\[
C_H \propto 2 \sum_{i=1}^{N} 2\pi r_i
\]

where:

- \(C_H\) is the **Howland geometric capacitance** of the O(o)O structure,
- \(r_i\) is the effective orbital radius of the \(i\)-th sub‑particle,
- \(k\) counts how many distinct charge‑like sources inject energy into the neutral “cap” per full cycle.

**Interpretation:**  
The capacity of the O(o)O structure to store and later return energy is **geometrically quantized** by the internal orbital circumferences and **scaled by how many charged participants are feeding it each cycle**. Two fighters throwing punches → twice the energy available to store and route through the neutral vacuum cap.
