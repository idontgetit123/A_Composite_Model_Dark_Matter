### Speculative Note: Black Hole Processing as a Source of Neutraltrons and Negatons

If neutraltrons (and related composites such as negatons) are geometric–capacitive structures rather than Standard Model bound states, then their formation may not require early‑universe conditions alone. Black holes provide an alternative pathway: an environment where normal matter is stripped of its familiar structure and reassembled under extreme curvature and field intensity.

Near the event horizon, infalling matter is reduced to its fundamental charge and field components. In this region, quantum fluctuations, intense charge separation, and extreme spacetime curvature create conditions where non‑standard composites can form. If the vacuum supports geometric capacitance modes, then a positive contributor, a negative contributor, and a neutral dielectric mode may lock into a stable resonance, producing a neutraltron. Variants of this process could yield related structures such as negatons.

Hawking radiation, normally modeled as thermal emission from quantum fluctuations at the horizon, could therefore include rare but stable geometric composites formed during this shredding–recombination process. In this view, black holes act not only as sinks for ordinary matter but also as factories that convert visible matter into dark modular composites. These products would be electrically neutral, long‑lived, and weakly interacting—matching the expected properties of dark matter.

### What We Know (Standard and Proposed Composites)

In the Standard Model, quarks combine into well‑known three‑body structures such as protons (uud) and neutrons (udd), held together by the strong force. These baryons demonstrate that nature already favors stable, confined triplets with distinct charge roles. Extending this idea, a neutraltron could arise from a different triplet configuration—one not bound by QCD but by geometric capacitance and resonance. A proposed “ude” composite, where the u‑role acts as the positive contributor, the d‑role serves as a neutral dielectric stabilizer, and the e‑role provides the negative contributor, matches the functional structure required by the O(o)O module. Under extreme conditions such as Hawking radiation, additional combinations like “dde” or “edd” may also form, representing alternative neutral or negative‑biased geometric composites. These would be rare in normal environments but could emerge naturally in the intense curvature and field gradients near black hole horizons.
