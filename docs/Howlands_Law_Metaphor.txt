Two guys walk into a bar:  
one Positive, one Negative.

Positive has a 40‑inch waist.  
Negative has a 45‑inch waist.  
(Their waistlines are really just their orbital circumferences in disguise.)

A Neutral guy walks in behind them.  
Neutral’s waist doesn’t matter — he’s not here to fight.  
He’s here to store energy.

Positive and Negative immediately square up to punch each other.  
But every time they swing, Neutral jumps between them and takes the hit.

That hit becomes his gas tank.

Fueled up, Neutral sprints counter‑clockwise around Positive.  
He burns all the gas exactly halfway through the loop —  
right when Positive and Negative throw another punch.

Boom — Neutral gets hit again.  
Tank refilled.

Now he runs clockwise around Negative.  
Again, he burns out right in the middle,  
right when the next punch is thrown.

Boom — another refill.

And this cycle repeats forever:

- punch  
- Neutral absorbs energy  
- Neutral runs a loop  
- runs out of gas exactly at the midpoint  
- punch  
- refill  
- loop  
- repeat  

Meanwhile, the size of Positive’s and Negative’s waists  
(40 inches and 45 inches)  
determines how much gas Neutral can hold each time.

Bigger waist → bigger loop → more gas capacity.  
Smaller waist → smaller loop → less gas capacity.

That’s the whole idea.

Howland’s Proposed Law (in plain English)

The amount of energy the Neutral guy can store  
is proportional to the size of the loops  
he has to run around the Positive and Negative guys.
